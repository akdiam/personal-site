# Adam Kim's personal site

Powered by Svelte, a light-weight, state-driven front-end framework that's (IMO) more readable than other popular front-end frameworks. I've also heard claims that because it chooses not to use a virtual DOM and instead [compiles your svelte code into optimized JS](https://lihautan.com/deep-dive-into-svelte/) during the build process, performance is generally better than React etc. 

I don't know how which of these claims are truth and which are marketing tactics. I haven't built any apps that expose performance differences between frameworks, if there even are any of significance. I do know that Svelte is fun to write, and I enjoy the fact that it's more of an extension of the pure JS/HTML/CSS paradigm rather than a framework with a million new functions & features.
