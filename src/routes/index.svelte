		Hi! I'm Adam.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm a <b>senior</b> at the University of Michigan studying <b>computer science engineering</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm always pushing myself to build <i>clean, maintainable,</i> and <i>extensible</i> software that works.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also enjoy making music with friends (I've played the double bass for ~11 years), listening to music, being active, and watching films.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're interested in my experiences, here's my resume. You can also poke around the 'experiences' page.
